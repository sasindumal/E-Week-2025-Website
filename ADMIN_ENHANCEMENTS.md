}

interface ParticipantData {

  name: string;
  batch: string;
  eventId: number;
  isCaptain?: boolean;
  email?: string;
  studentId?: string;
}

interface EventCompletionData {
  eventId: number;
  batch: string;
  winners: {
    first: WinnerData;
    second: WinnerData;
    third: WinnerData;
  };
}
```

## 5. Database Integration

### Sample Data Structure:

- Teams with member information
- Participants with contact details
